manjaro but bad OS (archiso based)

# instructions:

make sure to:
make partions
and mount shit

then run the installer

-how to run the installer
-
run `chmod +x /etc/install-mbb-OS`
then `/etc/install-mbb-OS`

-

the wallpaper may glitch when you run gdm inside the mbbISO to fix that run
`fixwallpaper.sh` found in /usr/bin (i think) or /usr/local/bin (i think too)
